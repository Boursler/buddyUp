- Terms and Conditions of Use -

Finding the kind of friendship that can last a lifetime is not only possible, but likely.  BuddyUp works hard to deliver you the most compatible friendship choices possible. We believe in empowering you to make the best choices by providing guidance and support to help you discover your best qualities and those of your potential “buddies” throughout your search.

As with anyone you meet—online or offline—your sound judgment and instincts are necessary to protect yourself. There is no substitution for acting with caution when communicating with someone you are just getting to know. Here are some essential “rules-of-the-road” for safely navigating any relationship, but especially one that begins online. 

1. Always Use Your Best Judgment

While BuddyUp routinely monitors account activity and investigates all complaints of unusual, inappropriate or falsified accounts, BuddyUp does not conduct criminal background checks at the time an account is registered. As with any personal interaction, keep in mind it is always possible for people to misrepresent themselves. Assessing a “buddy's” truthfulness and honesty is ultimately your responsibility. Don't ignore any facts that seem inconsistent or "off." Trust your instincts and remember that you have control over the situation. If you're talking to someone online or by phone and they say things that raise your suspicions, consider ending the conversation. If you’re out on a “meeting,” either with a group or as a pair, and you feel uncomfortable, leave.

Also, be aware of these common red flags when you’re getting to know someone new. Watch out for someone who:

•	Immediately requests to talk or chat on an outside email or messaging service.

•	Claims that your introduction was “destiny” or “fate,” especially early in communication.

•	Claims to be from the U.S. but is currently living, working, or traveling abroad.

•	Asks for money, goods or any similar type of assistance, especially if you have never met in person.

•	Asks you to assist with personal transactions (depositing funds, shipping merchandise, etc).

•	Wants the friendship to progress faster or beyond the level in which you are comfortable.

•	Reports a sudden personal crisis and pressures you to provide financial assistance. Be especially wary if the person’s demands become increasingly aggressive.

•	Asks inappropriate questions.

•	Requests your home or work address under the guise of sending flowers or gifts.

•	Tells inconsistent or grandiose stories.

•	Gives vague answers to specific questions.

•	Urges you to compromise your principles.

•	Constantly blames others for troubles in his or her life.

•	Insists on getting overly close, very fast.

•	Claims to be recently widowed.

•	Disappears suddenly from the site then reappears under a different name.  If a buddy does any of the above activities or makes you suspicious in any other way, please report this as a “BuddyUp Concern” by emailing devteam@buddyup.com so that we can investigate the matter.

2. NEVER Share Financial Information or Certain Personal Information

•	NEVER give out your credit card number or bank information.

•	NEVER share your Social Security Number, mother's maiden name, or other private information that can be used to access your financial information.

•	NEVER send money to someone you meet online, especially by wire transfer.  Immediately stop communicating with anyone who pressures you for personal or financial information or attempts in any way to trick you into revealing it. 

3. Protect Your Account

When accessing your account from a public or shared computer, use caution and be aware of your surroundings so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

4. Be Cautious When Sharing Personal Information

We strongly encourage you to be cautious when sharing personal information that could reveal your identity. Never include your last name, email address, home address, telephone number, place of work or any other identifying information in your Internet profile or initial email messages. Take full advantage of our free guidelines, and resist the urge to provide a personal email or phone number right away, no matter how strong a connection to your buddy you may feel. Once you've given out personal information, you cannot take it back! We encourage you to get to know a buddy well before taking the next step and sharing a telephone number, instant messenger handle or email address.

Phoning with the other person is an important step in getting to know each other better. But before you share phone numbers, make sure you have discussed the need to respect each other's privacy. If either of you decide to end communication in the future, agree not to use the phone number as a means to pursue an unwanted friendship. For added security, try using your phone's privacy features when you call, like private number blocking.

5. Do Your Own Research

While we conduct certain types of screening and utilize a variety of screening technologies and resources, such as screening our U.S. subscribers against public sex offender registries in the United States, it is important to remember that such screenings are inherently limited. Registries can be incomplete or inaccurate, and states and jurisdictions differ as to what type of crime must be registered on their registries and what types of crimes get removed. Many crimes often go unreported and perpetrators are not always convicted. Relying solely on screening can provide a false sense of security, so we strongly recommend that you follow the rest of the security guidelines regardless of any screenings that we may perform. When it comes to your personal safety, you are in ultimate control.

We rely on the honesty of our members when filling out our BuddyUp profiles to supply us with their correct date of birth, marital status, city and state of residence, occupation, educational background and other information.

Regardless of the connection you feel with any of your buddies, we encourage you to do your own research before meeting in person. This can include typing your buddy's name into a search engine, contacting your state or local municipalities to obtain public information, or using a paid service to obtain a full background report. Above all else, use common sense. Pay attention to the details someone shares with you. If you find anything that doesn't seem to add up, follow your intuition and stop communicating with that person.

6. Use Caution When Deciding to Click on Any URL Link

We understand that a buddy may share a URL link to a favorite website or article as part of the get-to-know-you communication process. However, as a general practice, you should always use good judgment and be cautious when deciding to click on any URL links. In particular, be aware of links that lead to web pages which look similar or identical to the BuddyUp homepage, including its log-in fields. These links are typically sent as attempts to 'phish' for log-in information from users in order to compromise user accounts. You should report any such phishing attempts to BuddyUp immediately. The only way to log in to your BuddyUp account (through our webpage) is by directly accessing the BuddyUp website at www.buddyup.com.

7. Take Your Time

While online communication can accelerate one's sense of comfort and security, we can't stress enough how important it is for you to take your time getting to know your buddy. We encourage you to use BuddyUp's anonymous text messaging system as long as necessary to find out as much about your buddy as is reasonably possible.

Even though it may appear that the BuddyUp website reveals extremely compatible people, compatibility alone does not replace the need for real-life experience. It is vital to meet and get to know each other thoroughly by sharing a broad base of experiences. The more experiences you share, the better your chances of avoiding hidden and sometimes unpleasant surprises. So allow time for a variety of experiences to occur, particularly your everyday routines. Move slowly and pay attention to the reality of your new friendship.

8. Make Your First Meeting Safe and Successful

Meeting in person is exciting. Have fun and explore the level of chemistry you share with your buddy, but don't let high hopes cloud your ability to exercise reasonable caution.


Do:
•	Choose the time and place of your meeting wisely. Meet in a public place at a decent hour during which lots of people will be around. Lunch meetings work especially well.
•	Limit alcohol consumption or abstain entirely until you know the person better.
•	Use your own transportation, even when meeting someone who lives a great distance away from you. Never agree to be picked up at your home. It's never a good idea to get into someone's personal vehicle on a first meeting. Wherever possible, drive yourself or take a cab, train, Uber or a Lyft.
•	Tell at least one friend or family member about your plans and when you will return. Arrange to check in with them after each of the first few meetings.
•	Carry a fully charged mobile phone with easily accessible emergency numbers.

Don't:
•	Leave unattended personal belongings such as purses, wallets, or jackets with pockets that may contain items that could reveal personal information about you, such as a driver's license, credit cards and ATM receipts.
•	Meet at your house or place of work or give that information out until you have had a good opportunity to get to know your buddy better.
•	Incur large expenses on a meeting without first discussing how the cost will be divided.
•	Go home with someone, even if it feels like everything is going great. You have not spent enough time with them to assess whether your safety is at risk.

9. Always be Respectful and Kind

Always be respectful and treat your buddies as you would want them to treat you. Not every meeting is going to be right for you, so closing communication with buddies and having buddies close communication with you is a natural and healthy part of the process. BuddyUp is about bringing two or more compatible people together who have a solid foundation from which long-term friendships have a high probability of success. You still need to carefully consider whether this particular person or group is one with whom you would like to further a friendship. If you feel the need to end communication, then be honest, direct and polite. The sooner you address this determination, the better for everyone.

If a buddy feels the need to close communication with you, please respect their wishes, as well.

10. Report Concerns About a Buddy to BuddyUp

BuddyUp works hard to identify and remove individuals who misrepresent who they are on our site, and we take our member’s complaints seriously. If you have concerns about a particular buddy, please do not hesitate to report the person to us so that appropriate steps can be taken to keep BuddyUp safe. You can report this person directly from their profile page or from within your profile page. Once reported, this information will be sent directly to our Trust & Safety team for review. Please be assured that all reports are kept completely confidential.

If BuddyUp closes an account for suspect activity, inappropriate behavior or falsified identity, you may be notified via email to discontinue communicating with the person in question. We strongly encourage all of our members to review emails received from BuddyUp to ensure this communication is received promptly.

11. Your BuddyUp Development Team

Be advised that you will never be contacted by an associate of the BuddyUp Development Team asking for personal, financial or any other information that was not provided at the time of your account creation.  Any and all communication with a member of our support team will come directly from the email address devteam@buddyup.com and that communication will not ask for any data of this nature.  We also remain resolved to NEVER share any personal information, email address or browsing data and history with ANY OTHER external source, third party or other persons, for any reason whatsoever.  This information is for internal use only and is requested at the time of your account creation in an effort to enhance your experiences with the BuddyUp website and mobile application.
 
We hope these guidelines will help to make your BuddyUp experience a success, and that you will find a lifelong buddy or buddies, as so many others before you have done.

Sincerely, 

Your BuddyUp Development Team
