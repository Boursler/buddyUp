*A few things you should consider when discussing your presentation:*

     * The structure of your presentation

     * The key messages you need to show

*AND*

     * Talk about _what not to talk about_ (you only have 10 minutes to talk).

~~ *Just remember* ~~

*The presentation of any project to an audience should flow like a story. Your narrative should open on a conflict, hint at a potential resolution for that problem, depict the steps taken to resolve the issue, and finally end on the resolution of the conflict with an eye toward the future. In other words:*

     * What problem does your app focus on.

     * How does your app solve this problem at a high-level.

     * What steps did you take to build the app.

     * Show the app running and solving the problem that began your story. Also talk about what features you’d like to add in an update to your app.

*The industry professionals want to see all of these things, so practice up and put together a good “elevator pitch” for both your app and for yourself as an individual!* (edited)
